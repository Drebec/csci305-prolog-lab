16. I enjoy how straightforward Prolog is. I also enjoy how rules can be used in different ways by changing which term is variable.
17. I don't like how prolog programs are run. There's no command line interface like the other languages we've used.
18. I did enjoy this lab. It was simple enough, but still covered a lot of different basic Prolog topics.
19. Approximately XXXXXXX hours.
20. I don't think I will ever use Prolog again. I can see it being useful for database systems though.
