1.  ?- father(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').
    X = 'King George VI' ;

2.  ?- grandmother(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').
    X = 'Queen Mary' ;
3.  ?- grandfather(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').
    X = 'King George V' ;

4.  ?- grandparent(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').
    X = 'King George V' ;
    X = 'Queen Mary' ;

5.  ?- grandparent('Queen Elizabeth II', X).
    X = 'Prince William' ;
    X = 'Prince Henry' ;

    X = 'Princess Margaret' ;

    X = 'Prince Charles' ;
    X = 'Prince Andrew' ;
    X = 'Prince Edward'.

8.  ?- daughter(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').
    X = 'Princess Anne' ;

9.  ?- aunt(X, 'Lady Diana Spencer').
    false.
    Lady Diana Spencer has no aunts in this family tree so this makes sense.

10. ?- spouse(X, 'Prince William').
    X = 'Catherine Middleton'.

    X = 'Prince Charles' ;
    X = 'Lady Diana Spencer' ;

    X = 'Queen Mary' ;
    X = 'King Edward VII' ;
    X = 'Princess Alexandra of Denmark' ;
    X = 'Prince Albert' ;
    X = 'Queen Victoria' ;
    false.

12.?- descendant('Queen Victoria', Y).
    false.
    Queen Victoria is a descendant of nobody in this family tree so this makes sense.

13. ?- older('Prince Henry', 'Prince William').
    false.

14. ?- older(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').
    false.
    Queen Elizabeth II lived to be 92. Longest of anyone in this family tree.

    X = 'King George V' ;

16. I enjoy how straightforward Prolog is. I also enjoy how rules can be used in different ways by changing which term is variable.

17. I don't like how prolog programs are run. There's no command line interface like the other languages we've used.

18. I did enjoy this lab. It was simple enough, but still covered a lot of different basic Prolog topics.

19. Approximately 3 hours.

20. I don't think I will ever use Prolog again. I can see it being useful for database systems though.

EC1.	?- cousin(X, 'Prince Charles').
	X = 'Viscount Linley' ;
	X = 'Lady Sarah Chatto' ;
	X = 'Viscount Linley' ;
	X = 'Lady Sarah Chatto' ;
	false.

EC2.	?- cousin('Prince Charles', X).
	X = 'Viscount Linley' ;
	X = 'Viscount Linley' ;
	X = 'Lady Sarah Chatto' ;
	X = 'Lady Sarah Chatto' ;
	false.
